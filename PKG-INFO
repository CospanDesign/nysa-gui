How to run: nui
  
Interact with FPGA in an easy to use environment.

If the Nysa environment is not initialized the GUI will install the required backend infrastructure to develop and interact with FPGAs

When the application is started the GUI will scan your computer for compatible 
boards (even simulated boards). After this it will interrogate the first 
boards and determine it's behavior. The GUI will then show a visual 
representation of the FPGA image. Users can click on a core to show what 
controllers are available. Double clicking on a script will open up a visual 
controller for that core.

For example clicking on a 'GPIO' slave will display 'GPIO Controller' 
double clicking on the GPIO Controller will open up a visual interface to 
control the GPIOs allowing users to set the direction of pins and set the 
values
  
Clicking on the 'ibuilder' tab on the bottom left of the GUI will open up the 
visual programming interface that allows users to build images for their FPGA 


'cbuilder' interface is under development
